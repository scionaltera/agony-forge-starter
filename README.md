# The Agony Forge - Starter
**A development kit for web based MUDs.**

The Agony Forge is a modern, web based MUD development kit. It is split into two parts: the Core contains all the code to run the game and the Starter is the customizable data for you to make your own game. 

This project is a starter kit. If you want to make your own MUD, this is where you start. You can fork this project and start to make changes to the files in here. When you run it, it will pull the Agony Forge Docker container from Docker Hub and apply all your settings. No compiling or coding required!
